# Classification of Stellar Entities using Machine Learning Techniques with Apache Spark 

‚ú® Stellar classification is a machine learning task in which the goal is to correctly 
classify a stellar object on the basis of its spectral characteristics. There are many 
ways to implement a system that is capable to perform this task. 

üßë‚Äçüíª The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning technique with Apache 
Spark, using Pyspark, a Python library that allows to exploit the Apache Spark 
strengths. This approach has been useful to perform data exploration, data preparation 
and machine learning classification, testing many state of the art machine-learning 
models, exploiting the data structure and particularities that Spark has to offer, 
following the CRISP-DM methodology.
